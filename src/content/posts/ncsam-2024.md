Itâ€™s that **haunting** time of the year and as our vast amount of digital information flows through the ether like water in the **deep dark** seas, **ghoulish** cyber criminals are **lurking** around every corner to devour your **digital sweet treats**.

Every October, [National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM)](https://staysafeonline.org/programs/cybersecurity-awareness-month/) provides a platform for cybersecurity experts to share their knowledge and insights. It's a time to highlight the growing importance of cybersecurity and to educate the public about how to protect themselves from cyber threats.

This NCSAM I want to focus on a few tips to keep all our digital sweets safe this year:

## Beware the Digital Trick-or-Treat: Smishing, Phishing, and Vishing Treats

Don't be fooled by **spooky** emails and texts! Cybercriminals can disguise themselves as legitimate senders. Be cautious and avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Always verify sender information before doing anything.

## Monster Proof Your Passwords
Passwords are the wards that protect your digital realm from lurking horrors. 
* Keep them unique and strong, like a warding spell that can't be easily broken. 
* Never reuse a password, lest you invite a monster into your digital home.
* Never share your password with anyone, even those who claim to be friendly. For in the digital world, even the most innocent-looking stranger could be a monstrous threat.
* Escape the **evil and dark eyes** of Cyber-ghouls - ditch passwords for [PassKeys](https://www.keepersecurity.com/blog/2023/10/17/passkey-vs-password-whats-the-difference/).
* Ward off **wicked wizards** - shield yourself and embrace Multi-Factor Authentication.

## Creepy Public WiFi
Public Wi-Fi can be as dangerous as a **haunted house**, filled with **ghostly threats**. Avoid connecting to unsecured networks, or you might find your digital soul trapped in a **cyber-haunted house**. Always use a VPN to shield yourself from the lurking **cyber-ghouls**.

## Privacy Protection Serum
Your online identity is a delicate artifact, a fragile piece of you. **Protect** it from the **phantom scavengers** of the digital realm. Review and adjust your online and social media privacy settings like a witch or warlock warding off unwanted spirits. Keep your personal information hidden, a secret potion known only to you. Similarly, be cautious of what you post online as this could lead to possible social engineering attacks.

## Ghostly and Haunting Updates
**Sinister** software vulnerabilities can lurk in the shadows of your devices. Regularly update your operating systems, apps, and antivirus software to **exercise** these digital demons and keep your devices safe from **haunting** threats.

## Phantom Endpoints
Ward off **ghoulish threats** with a digital shield. Install endpoint protection software that guards your devices against malware, ransomware, and other malicious entities that **lurk in the digital shadows**.

## Beware of AI and Deepfake Spooks
As the use of AI grows like a **monstrous vine**, we must beware of its **dark** side wielded by **ghoulish** cybercriminals. These digital **monsters** can fabricate images, doctor reports, and create haunting audio and video files to spread deception and misinformation. Be cautious, **question the validity of these items**, and avoid clicking on any **malicious** attachments or embedded videos that might trap you in a digital nightmare.

## Conclusion

In my final thoughts, while you're busy warding off **ghosts** and **goblins** this Halloween season, don't forget to **protect** your digital realm from the **lurking horrors of the cyber world**. By following these seven Halloween-inspired cybersecurity tips, you can ensure that your online presence remains as safe as your haunted house decorations. 

Stay safe and have a **spook-tacular Halloween**!
